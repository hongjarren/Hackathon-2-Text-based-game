Having your own doubt about the sudden disappearance of the energy, you gladly took on the task to venture into uncharted territories. After days of traveling on foot, you’ve finally arrived at the entrance of the mysterious area, and the first sight to greet you is a mysteriously dark forest, where your only guide is the mere torch on your hand. Nonetheless, you pressed forward, determine to unravel the mystery of the area……and your vague memories of the past you had in this area.\n",

Weird writings and symbols were written all over the walls. Do you wanna explore the ancient ruins? The floor suddenly fell apart, you tried to stabilize your body. After a few seconds, you finally hit the ground, albeit without any injuries thanks to your armor. You tried to look around with your torch and realized that you are now in an extensive underground cave.\n",

You followed the sound as they get louder and louder every step you make, and before long, you found yourself infront of a run-down entrance to what seemed like an abandoned mine. With no where else to go, you proceeded into the Haunted Cave.\n",

The deeper you walk into the cave the clearer the image in your head becomes, it resembles an area with lots of water, glowing even when theres no light nearby. You shrugged the image off, thinking it was just hallucinations due to the intense pressure you felt when entering the haunted cave. Before long, you are met with 3 choices on your path.\n",
        "1)     You notice a ghastly apparition in front of you , blocking one of the way forward in the tunnels. It doesn’t seem particularly aggressive or dangerous for something that’s not of this world but nonetheless you have your weapons and spells at the ready should the need arise. Do you want to confront the ghastly apparition? A sense of nostalgia washed over you as you slowly approached the apparition, you cant explain why but it just felt as if it can be trusted. And as such you talked to it, and without and clues the apparition said: “Im sure you are looking for THE LAKE” you were taken aback by that revelation as to how he knew what images you had earlier but still decided to affirm to it. It showed you the way to move forward to reach what you were looking for.\n",
        "2)     Another opening of the tunnel seems to be free of obstruction and would prove to be a wise choice if you take that route, mitigating any trouble and conserving your energy. With exploration in mind, would you want to take this path in search of potential treasures that might aid you in your travels? Before long, you stumbled upon a huge locked chest. You bust open the lock with your sword with ease and went through the items in it. You found a piece of map that leads to an opening with what seems like a lake in the middle, with the words “what you seek lies in your memories”.\n",
        "3)     You placed your hands on the wall and felt as if the wall has an opening behind it. With the risk of exposing your position to unknown forces in the caves, would you like to destroy the wall and reveal the secret passage behind it? You successfully broke the wall, somehow without alerting anything nearby but you did head some smiles behind your ears. The secret passage, once revealed, suddenly had a suction force that pulled you into a huge opening, several miles below where you stood. You rubbed off the rubbles on your body and opened your eyes to a magnificent view of what can only be described as an enchanted lake, which coincidentally seemed like the image you had in your brain earlier."

It was a narwhal, but isn’t it weird to see a narwhal in a lake, was this what your memories meant by  “ENCHANTED” ? and what was the familiarity you felt when u saw it? With all these questions in mind, you walked towards the narwhal with nothing but a torch in your hand.[rewards]. The narwhal seemed delighted as you approached it, like a dog towards its owner, you have an idea as to why but refuse to give thoughts about it. You follow the narwhal until you two break the water surface and what greeted you was a sight so depressing you cant help but think, ”what happened here”?\n",

You have no explanation as to why you thought it was a good idea to grab it but you are sure it was the right thing to do.[rewards]. After collecting the stones, you decided to keep swimming deeper into the vast lake, along the way , you are sure that youre being followed by a creature, a gentle creature with no harm towards you. After what felt like hours, you finally break the surface of the water? Why didn’t you felt tired? Maybe it was the stones you collected? More mysteries appears as you stand in shock as to what horrible things happened to the village that you have arrived at.\n",

There are voices telling you that the events are significant but this time, you decided to shut them out and do what you want. With a deep breath , you dive and swam , following the gentle current of this “ Enchanted lake” to wherever it brings you to.[rewards]. As you jumped into the lake, without a care to your surroundings, you suddenly hear a voice “I applaud your bravery” it was brief and seems to have no meaning behind it but one thing’s for sure is that, the next moment you opened your eyes, its as though you were teleported, to a place where the word “society” doesn’t seem to makes sense."

Now, all alone and in an unknown place, you decided to investigate the area.\n",

Once you entered the building, you realize it was the town hall and that there was still no one in it. You looked around and soon after, you came across a box, will you open it ? You found a letter in the box, as well as some treasures. The letter read: “follow the tall path that dangers you the most” , and with it attached a drawing of what seems like the edge of a mountain. With that you decided to follow the only trail leading out of the city.\n",

You are sure that it’s from a human, the cries were strong with emotion, sounded like a child, although you are certain you did not detect any human lives nearby. With hearts full of question you followed the voice to an abandoned house. Inside you saw a spirit of a little child. The child is a spirit indeed, but not a malicious one. Will you choose to approach the child? You comforted the spirit and learnt that it was still lingering in the mortal realm due to unfulfilled wishes, which was for someone to learn about their fall and the fall of their peoples. You asked what had transpired here, and was told that the village was destroyed by an unseen force a few nights back. Coincidentally it was around the same time the magic surrounding this area was lifted. Now, more than ever, you are determined to find the cause of the disturbance , and so you asked the spirit: “Where should I go next” ?\n",

Before long, you come across a locked metal door, but it was too old to be locked properly and with a swift kick, the door fell down. Will you enter the “archive”. There were drawings all over the walls, which seemed as though it was drawn in a hurry. Many of them pictures humans walking along a mountain pass. But what does it all mean? Armed with the knowledge from the picture, you pressed on, following the only trail out of the village."

But you might find clues as to what happened to this place along the way. Would you want to take this risky path? As you slowly scale the mountain path, you made sure to stick close to the walls, each step you took felt like it was your last. At some point, you found something sticking out of the walls and just grabbed it. And after what felt like an eternity, you finally reached the other side of the mountain and is now facing a new challenge.\n",

You solved the riddle, although it was hard, but it feels as though you’ve heard such questions before.

You know that to get to the other side of the mountain , its either scaling the dangerous mountain pass, or take your chances braving the icy biome. Will you choose to take this path? You can feel your body freezing to the point of no return, yet your will still pushes you forward. It felt like the cold could take away your life at anytime, but it didn’t, what’s up with that? Along the way you came across something shiny on the floor and picked it up. And after a few minutes, you are finally out of the freezing torment and is now faced with a new challenege."
