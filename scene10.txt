As you approached the door, you feel a sting in your head, as though a curse draws you closer to the opening, and before long, you are faced with a wizard who looks so wise, yet so malevolent. You have no choice but to engage in a battle with him as you know that is the only way you can learn about the mysteries of your past here.
You have defeated the wizard, and as a reward for you, the wicked wizard finally lifted the curse on you and memories starts to flood back in. “You were a novice adventurer back then, arrived in this mysterious area years ago alongside your sister. Guided by your own choices which are exactly the same choices that you took each step of the way now, you embarked on a perilous journey, gradually unraveling the secrets of the land. However, upon reaching the door, a malevolent curse befell you, wiping away your memories of the past and separating you from your sister, who was taken hostage by an unknown force. Now, standing victorious over the defeated boss, memories flood back to your  mind like fragments of a shattered mirror. As the haze of forgotten recollections lifts, you realize that  your sister is nowhere to be found. The realization hits you with a mix of relief and anguish, for your memories have returned, but your sister's fate remains unknown.”
